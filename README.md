Unfinished - due to getting a demanding job.

In hindsight, a presentation tool should be extremely portable.

a simple tool for presenting explanations on a computer

## Design idea

Instead of creating slides, which one flips through, the screen is like a view on a dynamic infinite whiteboard. Slides are basically pictures, which are presented in a fixed order, assuming that there are no animations. Needless animations distract and slides present a huge amount of information at one time. 

The presentation works on pictures, which the presenter tool shows on different part of the screen. Existing content can be moved out of the way (move animation), while new content can be revealed gradually (usually left to right). This is like older blackboards, where the whole blackboard is moved upward, while the teacher writes no content.

Except for text and few simple graphical elements, all other content is better created by specialized tools.
